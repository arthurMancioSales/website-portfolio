		<p class="text-long">
			From a young age, I have always believed that it's in the moments of difficulty where we improve the most. This mantra has made me constantly look for new challenges. Doing the bare minimum or the same old thing was not my type. And even before graduating from the SESI 182 Educational Center in the city of São José dos Campos, São Paulo - Brazil, class of 2021, I found myself seeking the challenge of international graduation.
		</p>
		<p class="text-long">
			It was then that I met the Van Veen Institute, a watershed from the very first moment. There I found support and advice. I found myself. I went through the most challenging moments of my life. And therefore, through the deepest phase of improvement.
		</p>
		<p class="text-long">
			Through this portfolio, I would like to present a little of the path I have walked so far. Of the defeats and victories that made me who I am.

				<div class="carousel-text">
					<p class="text">
						I have always been the stereotype of the technology kid. It was common for teachers to ask me for help in finding platforms or tools to make the class more interesting. That was when the Cyber Leader project came up at my school. 
					</p>
					<p class="text">
						As a Cyber Leader, my role was to look for ways to use technology to improve the school. I received training to use Office tools that go beyond the standard.
					</p>
					<p class="text">
						I used Blender, a 3d modeling software, to make geometry lessons more interactive and hands-on. Also, using Sway to produce presentations and assignments became a routine. Keeping track of the progress of activities and lectures with Planner became easier. And finally, we created the first digital interclass in the SESI school system.

				<div class="carousel-text">
					<p class="text">
						I entered the world of robotics very early, and because of that, the maker culture has always been something usual. But, when I discovered that my school would have a FAB-LAB, a Maker lab idealized by MIT, I realized that not everyone was in the same situation as me.
					</p>
					<p class="text">
						To compensate for this gap, my school created the Maker Leader program, where outstanding Maker students would help this culture become more widespread in the school. And I had the privilege of being one of them.
					</p>
					<p class="text">
						I could use everything from laser cutting machines to 3D printers. But what amazed me the most was following the students discovering themselves. I followed and tutored the widest range of projects possible. I used laser-cut acrylic to make nameplates for the local flora and modeled models to be 3D printed.
